# SpecBridge

SpecBridge is an open-source iOS toolkit that connects Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses to **Twitch**. It serves as a bridge between the Meta Wearables Device Access Toolkit (DAT) and standard broadcasting protocols, allowing developers to build custom live-streaming experiences.

*Note: While the underlying architecture supports RTMP (allowing for potential YouTube/Kick support), this version is currently hardcoded for Twitch.*

## Features
- **Live Video Bridge:** Routes raw video frames from Ray-Ban Meta glasses directly to Twitch.
- **Audio Handling:** Manages iOS audio sessions to prevent Bluetooth disconnects during streaming.
- **Secure Auth:** Setup screen to input and store your Twitch Stream Key locally on the device.
- **Modern Swift:** Uses Swift Concurrency (async/await) and the Actor model for thread-safe streaming.

## Prerequisites

Before attempting to build this project, ensure you have the following:

### Hardware
- **Mac:** A Mac computer capable of running Xcode.
- **iPhone:** An iPhone running iOS 17.0 or later.
- **Smart Glasses:** Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 2).

### Software & Accounts
- **Xcode 15+:** Required to compile the Swift code.
- **Meta View App:** Installed on your iPhone and paired with your glasses.
- **Twitch Account:** To obtain your Stream Key.

### Important: Enable Developer Mode
You must enable Developer Mode on your glasses for them to communicate with third-party apps like SpecBridge.

1. Open the **Meta View** app on your iPhone.
2. Navigate to the **Devices** tab (Glasses icon).
3. Tap the **Gear icon** (Settings) > **General** > **About**.
4. Tap the **Version** number 5 times repeatedly.
5. A "Developer Mode" toggle will appear. Switch it to **ON**.

## Installation

This application is not available on the App Store. You must build and install it directly onto your iPhone using Xcode.

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Download the source code to your Mac.

2. **Open in Xcode**
   Double-click `SpecBridge.xcodeproj` to open the project.

3. **Resolve Dependencies**
   Xcode should automatically detect and fetch the required libraries (Meta Wearables DAT and HaishinKit).
   *Note: If errors appear, go to File > Packages > Resolve Package Versions.*

4. **Sign the App**
   - Click the "SpecBridge" project icon in the top-left sidebar.
   - Select the "SpecBridge" target in the center panel.
   - Go to the **Signing & Capabilities** tab.
   - Select your personal Apple ID under the "Team" dropdown.

5. **Deploy to iPhone**
   - Connect your iPhone to your Mac via USB.
   - Select your iPhone from the device list at the top of the Xcode window.
   - Click the **Run** (Play) button.

## Usage Guide

Once the app is running on your phone, follow this specific sequence to start a stream.

### 1. Connect to Glasses
- On the setup screen, tap **Connect**.
- The app will redirect you to the **Meta View** app.
- Accept the connection request in Meta View.
- You will be automatically redirected back to SpecBridge.
- *Verify:* The status indicator in SpecBridge should show "Connected".

### 2. Configure Stream Key
- Once connected, the Stream Key field will become active.
- Enter your **Twitch Stream Key** (found in your Twitch Creator Dashboard > Settings > Stream).
- Tap **Save & Continue**.

### 3. Start Streaming
- You will see the main dashboard with a camera preview placeholder.
- Tap **Go Live**.
- **Wait for Cues:**
  1. You will hear an audio prompt: "Experience Started".
  2. The LED on your glasses will turn on.
  3. The video feed will appear on your iPhone screen.
- After a few seconds, your stream will be live on Twitch.

### 4. Stop Streaming
- Tap **Stop All** in the app to end the broadcast.
- You will hear an audio prompt: "Experience Stopped".

## Known Issues

- **Aspect Ratio Crop:** Currently, the stream broadcasts a 1:1 (Square) crop of the video feed, rather than the full 9:16 vertical video captured by the glasses. I'm investigating a fix for the buffer scaling.
- **Twitch Only:** This version does not yet support changing the RTMP URL to other services (Kick, YouTube).

## Roadmap

I'm actively working on the following improvements:
- **Full 9:16 Support:** Fixing the video pipeline to broadcast the full vertical field of view.
- **Multi-Platform Support:** Adding a settings menu to allow custom RTMP URLs (YouTube, Kick, etc).
- **UI Polish:** Improving the setup flow and status indicators.
